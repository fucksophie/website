                        I'm Latvian. I use any pronouns, and you can refer to me by "friend" or "yourfriend". :) I also love strawberries🍓, watermelons🍉, blueberries🫐 and pears🍐.

                        I use TS/JS and C#. I do small webdev projects from time to time like this. I also write backend servers for many games. I generally am most comfromtable using Deno and C#. I also have no issue working with C or Python.

I also administrate the game <a href="https://mppclone.com">MultiPlayerPiano</a>, which is a quite active piano game with a chat that's horrible to moderate.

Mostly used in the context of esoteric programming languages, somehow. The word can be expanded by inserting or prepending prefixes such as "cryo", "pyro", "chrono", "contra" or "meta" to convey additional meaning, e.g. "cryoapiocontraform".
